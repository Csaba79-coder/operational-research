solutoion with Integers on WebSite:

var x1 >= 0, integer;
var x2 >= 0, integer;

maximize z:     3*x1 + 2*x2;

subject to c11:   x1 +   x2 <=  9;
subject to c12: 3*x1 +   x2 <= 18;
subject to c13:   x1        <=  7;
subject to c14:          x2 <=  6;

end;

The task can be solved with Excel as well!
